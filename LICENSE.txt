## Trading Risk Disclaimer

Trading in financial markets involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable 
for all investors. The value of investments may go down as well as up. Past 
performance is not indicative of future results. You should carefully consider 
your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite before making 
any investment decisions. 

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your 
initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot 
afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading 
and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
